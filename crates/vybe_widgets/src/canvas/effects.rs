//! Shadow and filter — the two things a drawing passes through before it lands.
//!
//! HTML §4.12.5.1.13 defines one drawing model for every canvas operation, and
//! it is not "paint the shape". The shape is rendered to its own bitmap, that
//! bitmap is FILTERED, a shadow is derived from the filtered bitmap's alpha,
//! and only then is the pair composited onto the canvas. Doing it any other way
//! gets observable things wrong — a shadow of an already-shadowed shape, a
//! filter that misses the shadow, a `globalAlpha` applied twice.
//!
//! ## Why the blur lives here
//!
//! webcore had no blur at all. `display_list_replay.rs` says
//! `0 => {} // blur — needs convolution, skipped`, and `PaintCmd::BoxShadow`
//! and `PaintCmd::TextShadow` both destructure `blur: _`. So `shadowBlur`,
//! `filter: blur()`, CSS `box-shadow` and CSS `text-shadow` were four features
//! waiting on one missing primitive. [`blur_pixmap`] is that primitive; the
//! canvas uses it here, and the three renderer sites are now one call away from
//! using it too.
