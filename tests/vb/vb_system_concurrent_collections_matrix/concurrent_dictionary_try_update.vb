' Vybe test harness — Visual Basic.
'
' Real VB source alongside harness/go/check.go and harness/js/check.js, the way
' test262's assert.js is JavaScript.
'
' A test's verdict is its EXIT CODE. __Check prints its diagnostic BEFORE
' throwing: an uncaught exception surfaces as `RuntimeError: [object]`, which
' says nothing at all.
'
' Output is COLLECTED, not paired. The emitter rewrites every
' `Console.WriteLine(x)` into `__P(CStr(x))` and compares the whole output once
' at the end of `Sub Main`. Pairing the i-th print with the i-th expected line
' cannot assert anything about a loop, and loops alone were 402 of VB's 6,671
' cases.
'
' Rendering happens at the CALL SITE via `CStr`, where the expression still has
' its static type — the same reason the C# harness renders with `.ToString()`
' rather than inside the helper.
