' Vybe test harness — Visual Basic.

' Real VB source alongside harness/go/check.go and harness/js/check.js, the way
' test262's assert.js is JavaScript.

' A test's verdict is its EXIT CODE. __Check prints its diagnostic BEFORE
' throwing: an uncaught exception surfaces as `RuntimeError: [object]`, which
' says nothing at all.
