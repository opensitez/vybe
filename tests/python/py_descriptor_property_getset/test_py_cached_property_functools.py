# Vybe test harness — Python.
#
# The Python counterpart of harness/go/check.go and harness/js/check.js: real
# source in the language under test, the way test262's assert.js is JavaScript.
#
# A test's verdict is its EXIT CODE. `__check` prints its diagnostic BEFORE
# raising, because an uncaught exception surfaces as `RuntimeError: [object]`
# and tells you nothing — 1,692 of testecma's 2,158 failures say exactly that.

    a GENERATOR EXPRESSION as a call argument — returns the empty string under
    Vybe while CPython gives "1 x", and a harness must not depend on anything
    the runtime under test gets wrong. A list comprehension works, but a loop
    needs nothing at all: no comprehension, no `join`, no `range`.
